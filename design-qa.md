# Design QA - Daily Progress Report v3.7.8

## Comparison targets

### Menu ribbon

- Source visual truth: `C:/CODEX/SeaPilot/tmp/design/planning-menu-reference.png`
- Implementation screenshot: `C:/CODEX/SeaPilot/tmp/design/dpr-menu-implementation.png`
- Viewport and state: same in-app browser tab, 1265 x 712 capture, desktop preview dataset, no modal open.
- Comparison evidence: both captures were opened together in the same visual comparison input.

### Generated PDF

- Source visual truth: `C:/CODEX/SeaPilot/tmp/pdfs/goury-january-reference/page.png`
- Implementation render: `C:/CODEX/SeaPilot/tmp/pdfs/dpr-1071-reference-layout.png`
- Rasterization: Poppler at 72 dpi, one portrait page measuring 1896 x 2667.12 points.
- Comparison evidence: both full-page renders were opened together in the same visual comparison input.

## Findings

No actionable P0, P1 or P2 mismatch remains.

- The DPR menu uses the same ribbon component classes, two-row command grid, group separators, icon sizing, badges,
  active state, borders, radius and horizontal overflow behavior as the Planning menu.
- `Saisir un DPR` is the first command in the `DPR` group. `Production` and `Outils` preserve the same visual grammar.
- The PDF reproduces the supplied report frame: BBTM logo, oversized portrait canvas, project/date header, grey mission
  and QHSE section bars, two-column mission content, leading indicators, incident categories and italic footer.
- The exact source logo extracted from the user-provided PDF is reused. Interface icons remain from the project's
  Lucide library.
- Dynamic report values use the selected DPR payload; the filename repeats its DPR number, vessel and date.
- PDF and ZIP generation remain browser-local and create no Supabase object or PDF metadata.

## Interaction verification

- `Saisir un DPR` opens the six-step DPR dialog and the close action restores the workspace.
- Selecting the `P902` project group selects two reports and prepares the matching `DPR-1062 - 01/08/2026` preview.
- Production actions are disabled without a selection and become available from the selected group.
- Browser console errors: none.

## PDF verification

- One page, portrait, 1896 x 2667.12 points.
- Stable filename: `DPR-1071 - GOURY - 29-07-2026.pdf` for the fixture.
- Final Poppler PNG inspection: no clipping, overlap, missing asset, broken glyph or off-page content.

final result: passed
